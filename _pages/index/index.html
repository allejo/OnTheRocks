    <h2>Yes, another system</h2>
    <p>Yeup. Sorry about that. I know that both <a href="http://neat.bourbon.io/">Neat</a> and <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/">Susy</a> exist and they are amazing but this Sass library exists to make a flexbox based grid system. There is a lot of articles out there as to why to use flexbox and why not to use flexbox so this library isn't here to persuade you start using flexboxes; this library assumes you like flexboxes and want to use it for page layout.</p>
